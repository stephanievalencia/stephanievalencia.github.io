<h1> Net_Art </h1>
<h2> Hover over the page (left side) to discover three words; Flashbacks, Broken and Prosper. They are the titles of three poems I've written. They do not relate to one another, but they do indeed have a sort of similar melancholic feel to them. Flashbacks is the more heart wrenching and personal poem I decided to share. It is an English Sonnet I wrote back in Spring 2017 in memory of my uncle who passed away over a decade ago. 
Immerse yourself in the images (GIFs and slow mo video) and sound (have your sound on please) once you've clicked on one of the titles  slowly scroll down to read the poem(s). There are blank spots but if you hover over you will be able to read the entire poem. I also added the link back to the rest of the poems (Net_Art) in the bottom left corner to make it more simple to navigate through them in the order of your choice.

<br>
I was inspired by Mendi Lewis Obadike and her short personal story titled "keeping up appearances" which has a similar approach of hovering over to read the entire story. [ Feel free to Google it to see what I mean. ]
<br>
<br>
Enjoy!
