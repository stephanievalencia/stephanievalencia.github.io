	My concept is focused on spreading body positivity and embracing our differences. I am an advocate for healthy living and not letting our size stop us from feeling what we are, beautiful.
	I incorporated the different general body types of females with the use of shapes on the silhouettes while also adding distinct flowers placed inside each one to convey that they may be different but they are all beautiful in their own unique ways. 
	I also added some words and quotes into the silhouette to further exemplify my message. 

<br>
<br>
<br>

	“A flower does not think of competing with the flower next to it. It just blooms.”
