		<h1> flashbacks
	<br>
	by Stephanie Valencia </h1>
	<div>
		Thinking back to when I was in fourth grade
		<br>
		<br>
		with flashbacks of gut-wrenching sorrow,
		<br>
		<br>
		<p><font color="white">I can't help but feel tears start to cascade,</font></p>
		<br>
		<p><font color="white">hoping that day was all a night terror.</font></p>
		<br>
		<br>
		Early that morning I rushed to the scene <br>
		<br>
		<br>
		saw you laying motionless in the doorway,
<br>
<br>
	 	but as I ran to you... I was stopped! Unforseen,
	<br>
	<br>
	<p><font color="white">some officers reluctantly shooed me away.</font></p>
<br> 
		<br>
		I waited with family in a small room.
		<br>
		<br>
		We stayed hopeful, but soon were struck with heartache
		<br>
		<br>
		when the doctor came in and told us the news,
		<br>
		<br>
		that the wound in your heart could't keep you awake.
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>	
		<p><font color="white">You look so at ease with your hands near your chest,
			<br>
			<br>
		as we unwillingly put you to rest.</font></p>
	<br>
