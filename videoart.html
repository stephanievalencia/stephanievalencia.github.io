	In this short video, I hoped to convey a lighthearted portrayal 
	between reality and fantasy in terms of heartbreak 
	(reading in this case).
 	To make the work more dynamic, 
 	I incorporated different camera angles along with 
 	video transitions to help the entire video have fluidity.
  	I also think that with the addition of audio 
  	it helped to have both the lighthearted and melancholic mood I was going for. 
  	It was my first time editing on premier, 
  	and I must admit I ran into complications here and there. 
  	Nonetheless, I am very satisfied with the final product.
	I went with something more simple, 
	but I believe it works well. 
	Hope it causes you to chuckle a bit! 
	Enjoy!
